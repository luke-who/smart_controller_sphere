This project investigated how to integrate new functionality into an existing IoT home healthcare platform with a tangible UI design to facilitate user interaction.
# Project Timeline
## Prototyping on a breadboard
<img src="https://github.com/luke-who/smart_controller_sphere/blob/master/Design%26Implementation/Implementation/breadboard_prototype.jpg" width = 500/>
A Raspberry pi 3 B+ with various circuits boards, including DC, a motor,a motor controller and potentiometer were integrated to build the functionality of the design

## Circuit Encapsulation & Interface design

The design was encapsulated insided a 3D printed box & a dial was on top of it for user interaction

## Music Feedback
Music feedback was also added to the design to make the interaction more fun. We used the Super Mario theme song to gamify the experience.
