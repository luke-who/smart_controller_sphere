A replica of the 2019 summer internship project where I built a IOT smart controller using raspberry pi and various circuits boards(including **ADC, a motor,a motor controller&potentiometer**), the controller was coded in python

## The circuits were first prototyped on a braeadboard connected to a Raspberry pi 3 B+

## Then the circuits were encapsulated insided a 3D printed box with a 3D printed Dial on top of it
